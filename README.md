## 18864 The Midnight Development Team presents:
# ULTRAFAST

## Welcome!
This repository contains the WIP navigation library for FTC, ULTRAFAST.
I hear you ask, "But Mark, why should we use this instead of RoadRunner?".
And that's a great question.

## TODO:
### Literally everything:
- Hardware description classes
  - Low-level
    - Robot config (basically DriveConstants from RR)
    - Motors
    - Encoders (type and pos)
  - High-level (?)
    - Mecanum configuration
    - Maybe add IMUs as an option? anything goes at this point lmao
- Localization logic
  - Encoder ticks to distance from robot config
  - Localization from encoder distance travelled
- Path plotting
  - ?
- Following
  - idfk do da delta 

yeah you can tell i'm genuinely confused
